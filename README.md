# IBD research
New analysis and visualisations of published datasets related to inflammatory bowel disease.

I am re-analysing publicly available datasets to validate the published interpretations. 

Additionally, on a personal level I am using this to learn more about the field of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to gain experience working with new datasets.

You are welcome to take a look and please let me know if you would like to discuss any of this.
